            The Karan Desert is a vast desert situated in the Balochistan province in south-western Pakistan. This sandy
            and mountainous region also served as a site of Pakistan’s second nuclear test, Chagai-II, which was carried
            out on 30 May 1998.
            The region has a dry climate. The inhabitants of the region are usually into agriculture and farming. The
            terrain is mainly dry, gray-brown sand that stretches out.
            Although the Balochistan region is characterized by harsh and dry climatic conditions, the Kharan desert can
            be separated from the rest of the arid landscape due to its sandy nature and even terrain, ranging from 1000
            m in the north-east to 500 m in the west.
            The desert is situated in the Kharan District, covering an area of around 20,000 sq km with a population of
            only 0.23 million. In the north, east, and west it is surrounded by beautiful hills, up to 3000 meters,
            while on the west it extends into Iranian territories.

            17th largest desert and the world’s 9th largest subtropical desert.

            The third major desert in Pakistan is the Thal Desert. It is situated in Punjab, Pakistan between the Jhelum
            and Sindh rivers near the Pothohar Plateau. The Thal Desert has an approximate area of 20000 km square. It
            is also the third-largest desert in Pakistan. The desert extends over a length of 305km and has a width
            varying from 32km to as much as 112km. Around 50-60% of the desert is covered in dunes.
            The desert covers the districts of Bhakkar, Khushab, Mianwali, Layyah, Muzaffargarh as well as Jhang, from
            the left bank of the river Jhelum.
            Vegetation in the area is not possible because of hot and dry weather. The only vegetation possible in the
            region includes a few species of drought-resistant grass, shrubs, and trees. The inhabitants of the desert
            get the water from the Thal Canal. The water is used for everyday tasks, irrigation, and feeding the cattle.

            The Cholistan Desert, also known as the Rohi Desert among the locals is located in the southern region of
            Pakistan. The name is derived from the Turkic word chol, meaning “sands”, and istan, a Persian suffix
            meaning “land of”.
            In ancient years, the desert was a fertile region with water coming from the Himalayan range. The area later
            turned into a center for caravan trade which led to the establishment of many forts, including the Derawar
            Fort.
            Cholistan covers an area of 25,800 km2 (10,000 sq mi) in the Bahawalpur, Bahawalnagar, and Rahim Yar Khan
            districts of southern Punjab. The nearest major city is Bahawalpur city, 30 km (19 mi) from the edge of the
            desert.
            The desert is about 480 kilometers in length, with a width varying between 32 and 192 kilometers. 81% of the
            desert is sandy, while 19% is characterized by alluvial flats and small sandy dunes.
