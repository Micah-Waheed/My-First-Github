            The first hill station on our list is Murree (of course). It is one of the most famous tourist destinations
            in Pakistan. Every year, hundreds and thousands of local and international tourists visit this place.
            Murree is located on the outskirts of Islamabad, which means it is the perfect getaway place for people who
            are residing in Islamabad. Islamabad the second most beautiful capital of the world has some amazing places
            to visit and horror places as well. It’s almost one and a half hour’s drive to Murree from Islamabad.
            Murree is rich in history. It is an old town established by the British for their soldiers. It served as a
            sanatorium for troops for quite a long time. There are many theories related to the name “Murree”. Some
            people say that the name was derived from the Turkish word ‘marg’ which means ‘meadows’.

            Shogran is a gorgeous hill station located in Kaghan valley, one of the most beautiful valleys in Pakistan.
            Every year, hundreds of tourists visit Shogran because of its breathtaking beauty. It is at a height of
            2,362 metres (7,749 ft) above sea level.
            There are many staying options in Shogran but our favorite is Forest rest house. It is a cosy place with
            elegant wood furniture and décor. The forest-themed rest house is perfect for people who are traveling with
            family and friends.
            If you have kids with you then do take them to the mini zoo of Shogran. It is the house of many animals and
            birds. I’m sure the kids will adore it.
            If you want to look deeper into nature, then Malkandi forest is the place to be. The thick forest with its
            exotic variety of plants and birds is a heaven.
