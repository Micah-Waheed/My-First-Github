            Colloquially known as the “Mother of all Mosques,” the Begum Shahi Mosque was built between 1611 and 1614
            under Emperor Jahangir in honor of his mother, Mariam Zamani.
            The relatively small mosque sits across the way from the famous Lahore Fort, and is one of the oldest
            historical places in Lahore and is actually the city’s oldest surviving Mughal Era structure!
            The architectural design of Begum Shahi gave inspiration to the Wazir Khan Mosque that was built several
            decades later. The mosque itself is impressive- complete with elaborate 400+ year old frescoes and unique
            geometrical embellishments- but its namesake even more soMariam Zamani was far from average herself- the
            former Hindu princess was known for expanding the Mughal kingdom’s racial and religious tolerance when she
            married Emperor Akbar.

            You won’t have a complete list of historical places in Pakistan without including Mohenjo- Daro- one of the
            largest cities of the Indus Valley Civilization. The ancient city, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site,
            was built around 2500 BCE and remained undocumented for over 3700 years until archeologists discovered it in
            the early 1920’s.
            Mohenjo-Daro’s size (over 300 hectares) and inclusion of public buildings seem to represent a high level of
            social organization according to historians. Wild right? Though the ancient city is unknown by most people,
            it’s one of the most important landmarks in Asia.

            Lahore is chock-full of incredible pieces of history and it can easily have its own list. But as for this
            one, the beautiful Wazir Khan Mosque is a must- mention. The mosque took its architectural queues from that
            from the Begum Shahi, and though the similarities are evident, the Wazir Khan is notably larger and more
            colorful.

            Hindu temples in Pakistan- say what?! Yup you read that right- the Katasraj Temples are located near the
            village of Dulmial in Punjab and are said to be from the 7th Century CE or earlier. The temples surround a
            lake that is even fabled to have magical powers!
            The famous Hindu epic Mahabharata also gives them a mention, and it’s well known that the founder of the
            Sikh Faith- Guru Nanak- often visited the site in more recent centuries.

            The Kot Diji Fort can be found upon a hill in Kot Diji, Sindh, and though it ain’t that old- what’s
            underneath it sure is! The fort was built between 1785-1795 by Mir Sohrab Khan Talpur, but it actually lies
            above the remains of a pre-historic civilization by the same name.
            It’s believed that the remains date back as far as 3300 BCE, placing it before the Indus Valley/ Harappan
            Civilization. Yes- it’s real old!
            Unlike some of the other forts mentioned on this list, Kot Diji is a bit more offbeat and as such attracts
            fewer tourists! Both the fort and the remains can be found about 24 km south of the city of Khairpur.

            The Hiran Minar is one of the most popular historical places in Pakistan as far as visits are concerned. And
            though it is a tomb- this one is a bit different than others!
            Most tombs in Punjab and across Pakistan house the remains of saints or royals but the Hiran Minar is
            dedicated not to Mughal Emperor Jahangir, but his pet antelope.
            Yup you read that right- Emperor Jahangir was known for his love of nature and the Hiran Minar exemplifies
            that. It’s also set in a bit of a wilderness, which gave the Mughals a bit of a natural escape from the
            bustling city of Lahore.
